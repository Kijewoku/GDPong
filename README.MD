# Simple Pong Game with Godot 4

## Overview

This is a simple Pong project created with Godot 4 to explore and learn the software.

## Introduction

The project began by following this tutorial: [JetBrains Godot Pong Tutorial](https://www.jetbrains.com/guide/gamedev/tutorials/rider-godot-pong/introduction/). This tutorial helped me discover Godot using C#.

## Transition to GD Script

After completing the tutorial in C#, I adapted the project to GD Script to also learn this language. The original C# scripts are preserved in the `scripts.old.csharp` folder for reference, but the current project runs entirely on GD Script.

## Project Structure

- `scripts.old.csharp`: Contains the original C# scripts.
- `scripts`: Contains the GD Script files.
- `assets`: Contains graphics and audio ressources.

## Assets

The visual assets have been replaced with those from Hektor Profe. You can find them here: [Neon Pong by Hektor Profe](https://hektorprofe.itch.io/neon-pong).

## Original C# Project

If you prefer to work with the original C# version of the project, you can find it in the tutorial's repository: [JetBrains Rider Godot Pong](https://github.com/JetBrains/jetbrains-rider-godot-pong).

## Getting Started

To run the project:

1. Install Godot 4 from [Godot Engine's official website](https://godotengine.org/).
2. Clone this repository.
3. Open the project in Godot 4.
4. Run the project from the Godot editor.
